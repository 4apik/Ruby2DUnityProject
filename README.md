The final result of the long Unity tutorial. All assets were provided by the tutorial, but the rest is done by me. 

'Press X to speak to the frog. 
Press C to throw a cog (they fix robots).'

'Spikes and broken robots will damage you. 
Berries will heal you'

There is no window closing button, so just alt+f4 out of it :)
